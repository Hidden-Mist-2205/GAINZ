## Introduction
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user (Barry Swoleman). Add some more stuff here

## What does the app do?
* What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
* Why was it built?
* User Inputs and Outputs

## Tech Stack
* Front End: JavaScript, ReactJS, Recoil, Styled Components, React Router, Userfront
* Back End: NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Axios
* Testing/Utilities: Babel, Webpack, Jest

## Video Demo/Screenshots
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product

## How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
* OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?
