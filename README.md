## Introduction
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user (Barry Swoleman).
In recent years many people have been unable to visit the gym in person, and many of them miss the accountability being around other people can provide. The GAINZ application will allow users to access information on other peopleâ€™s workouts, and find other users of the service who share their interests or workout schedule

#### Key Features:
* Users are able to create accounts to do fitness workouts and follow along steps
* Users are able to find others with similar schedules to connect with and work out together
* Users can search for and create their own workouts to add to the community list of workouts

## Tech Stack
* Front End: JavaScript, ReactJS, Recoil, Styled Components, React Router, Userfront
* Back End: NodeJS, Express, PostgreSQL, Axios
* Testing/Utilities: Babel, Webpack, Jest

## Section breakdown (with demo)

The login, signup and forgot password forms implement UserFront for authentication within custom React forms that send information to our own database for user matching. Upon entering the app, users are sent to non-authenticated routes (like the landing page seen above) or protected auth-only routes depending on their access token.
