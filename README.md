## Introduction
This project was a brief 1-week sprint where our team tried to complete an MVP for an external user (Barry Swoleman). Add some more stuff here

## What does the app do?
* What problem does it solve? Who uses it?
* Why was it built?
* User Inputs and Outputs

## Tech Stack
* Front End: JavaScript, ReactJS, Recoil, Styled Components, React Router, Userfront
* Back End: NodeJS, Express, Sequelize, PostgreSQL, Axios
* Testing/Utilities: Babel, Webpack, Jest

## Technical Challenges
* Why, what was the plan to overcome those challenges?
* What did you learn?

## Video Demo/Screenshots
* What were the user stories /  what was MVP (mention Minimal Viable Product

## How does the app work?
* What happens behind the scenes when the user interacts with it?
* OR What are all the places the data travels?  What happens to that data?
* Optionally include a diagram
* How does the tech stack come together?

##Installation
1. Clone the repo
```
git clone http://
```

2. Install NPM dependencies
```
npm install
```

3. 

## Workflow & Key Lessons
* Your git workflow, style guides, commit guides, etc
* What did you learn from the process
* What were key takeaways from stand ups, code reviews, etc
* Writing tests
* Link to your trello board, discuss completed tickets

## Additional Features/Future Improvements
* Future refactoring?
* Additional dev ops considerations?
